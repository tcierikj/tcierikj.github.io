Are you geared to specify ovarian cyst laterality?
CMS has finally released the definitive code set update for the upcoming 2017 ICD-10-CM codes that will go into effect October 1. Even if your ICD-10 ob-gyn coding and documentation were flawless in 2016, you will need to put in some effort to make sure you can maintain your accuracy rate once the changes are effective.
These ICD-10 changes should come as good news for most of you since these have been on the list of things that needed improvement since 2012, but were not released due to the freeze and implementation delay. For instance, you had often thought you did not have a code option when a laparoscopic surgery becomes an open one. But effective Oct. 1, 2016, this issue gets resolved when you will add Z53.31 to your coding possibilities.
Check out some of the important gynecology coding changes coming your way, so you can start planning how to use them.
Vulvar Hypertrophy & Dyspareunia Changes
Learn the new specifications for hypertrophy and dyspareunia conditions. For vulvar hypertrophy, you will use three new codes in place of N90.6: N90.60, N90.61, and N90.69. While for dyspareunia, you will add N93.1. You will also delete the code N94.1. I and choose from four new codes: N94.10, N94.11, N94.12, and N94.19.
Expanded Choices for N83 Specify Laterality
You will have more specific ovarian cyst options as they expand to include unspecified, right, and left sides.  For instance, in place of N83.0, you will find these new codes: N83.00, N83.01, and N83.02.
Check Out These Gynecology Revisions
Apart from new codes, you will also have some revisions to master. Make sure you do not miss these ICD-10 ob-gyn coding revisions because even if you miss a simple descriptor terminology shift, your claim can turn into denials. For example, the descriptor of N99.113 will change from postprocedural anterior urethral stricture to postprocedural anterior bulbous urethral stricture. To put it simply, the wordbulbous has been added to the descriptor. Other codes which will have revisions include N99.520, N99.521, and N99.522, just to name a few. You will also have some postprocedural hemorrhage and hematuria revisions and additions to take note of.
Note Urogynecologic Diagnosis Change
Effective October 1, you will no longer use R31.2 as this code makes way for two new urogynecologic diagnosis codes: R31.21 and R31.29. You will also delete R39.19 and add the following codes: R39.191, R39.192, and R39.198 to your coding arsenal.
Vaginal Mesh and Prosthetic Diagnoses
You’ll also have to change the way you report vaginal mesh diagnoses as the descriptor for T83.711A will no longer include ‘other prosthetic materials’, thus clarifying that this code is used for vaginal mesh only.
These are just some of the important changes affecting gynecology coding and reimbursement. To know about other updates and how they affect your coding, make sure you have a reliable ICD-10 ob-gyn coding book by your side.
